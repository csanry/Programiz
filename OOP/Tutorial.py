"""This section covers Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python
and its fundamental concepts with the help of examples."""

# An object has two characteristics:
# - Attributes
# - Behavior

Using an example:
A parrot is an object as it has the following properties:
- Name, age, colour as attributes
- Squawking, repeating as behaviors

# Python Class

- A class is a blueprint for the object

- We can think of a class as a sketch of a parrot with labels - it contains descriptions
of attributes such as the name, colors, size etc. We can define the simplest class using

class Parrot:
    pass

An object is an instantiation of a class.
my_parrot = Parrot()
